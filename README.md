# LoopyAudioPlayer
 
A Audio Player which also can also loop a section of a soundfile.

You can move the borders for this section-loop. You can see them as orange triangles.

You can enable Crossfade with the checkbox and change the duration of it by clicking on the value.

On Closing the LoopyAudioPlayer will save all loop borders(along with some other things like volume, ect.) in a file named settings.json.

By Clicking the Folder icon you set music libraries, settings for audiofiles inside those will also be saved relative to the musik library.
This means you can move this folder and after setting the new path as a musik library the same loop-timestamps will be used. This can be useful for using the same settings file on different devices.
